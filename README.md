# Outlook-Scraper
This application looks in a specific folder and pulls all the attachments in the emails. It then pulls all the dataframes into a single dataframe.  Columns and rows with a low amount of information under the threshold given are removed.  The thresholds may need to be adjusted based on what is needed in the final dataframe
